# Professional Note Taker

## Welcome 

In this application I helped create a note taker using Node.js and Express.js. The front end code was given, while the back-end code was not. This application allows users to add notes, save them, and delete them too if needed. I linked up back-end code to work with the front end and deployed this application on Heroku.

## Languages Used

- Node.Js
- Express.Js
- HTML
- Css
- Javascript
